Submit observations, if any: Sometimes baking starts pending, time to stake freezes(time does not change or ticks plus minute-minus minute).
but it works.

When I clicked "Stop Baking" without entering my account password, I got the error "Oops, something went wrong: Unexpected HTTP response: 401:" cannot decrypt signing key with index 0: decryption failure: wrong password ". Baking did not stop.
When I entered my password and did the same "Remove Baker transaction finalized. Baking will stop in 1h54m" information came. 
There is no problem. I shared the screenshots in this folder.
